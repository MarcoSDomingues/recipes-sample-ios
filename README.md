# recipes-challenge

To run the project in xcode open the `Recipes.xcworkspace` as it contains the main project 
of the application and the two frameworks (for the domain layer, and for some UI elements - `RecipesDomain` and `RecipesUIKit` respectively)

The app supports dark mode for iOS 13, and I included some screenshots to showcase all the screens in light and dark mode.

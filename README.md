# recipes-challenge

To run the project in xcode open the `Recipes.xcworkspace` as it contains the main project 
of the application and the two frameworks (for the domain layer, and for some UI elements - `RecipesDomain` and `RecipesUIKit` respectively)

The app supports dark mode for iOS 13, and I included some screenshots to showcase all the screens in light and dark mode.

The project doesn't use any external libraries, so you should only have to run the application and you don't need to bother with cocoapods, carthage or swift package manager to setup external dependecies.
